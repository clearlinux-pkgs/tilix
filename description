Tilix is a tiling terminal emulator which uses the VTE GTK+ 3 widget. The
application was written using GTK 3 and an effort was made to conform to GNOME
Human Interface Guidelines (HIG). As a result, it does use CSD (i.e. the GTK
HeaderBar) though it can be disabled if necessary. Other than GNOME, only Unity
has been tested officially though users have had success with other desktop
environments.
